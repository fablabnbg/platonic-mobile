Platonic Mobile
===============

From templates found here, you can assemble a mobile of paper or cardbord objects.
All objects have rounded outsides, but still reseble one of the 5 platonic bodies.


The templates
=============

* pentagon_flower.svg  6 pieces

* square_flower.svg   12 pieces

* triangle_flower.svg 12 pieces


The pages are A4 Pages, two of them fit into a 400x300 lasercutter.
Each svg consists of a visible layer, filled with a number of identical copies of the 'flowers'.

The cuts in the flower petals are done 0.5mm wide. Suitable for paper or cardboard.
But you can easily change the dimensions of the cut. In the top lefhand object, you'll find a cut that 
is exactly horizontal. If you modify this cut (to e.g. 2mm wide) the change is reflected on all the other cuts
on the page. This is implemented, by making all other cuts in the top left hand objects svg-clones of the one that
is horizontal. And all other objects on the page are clones of the top lefthand object too.
The top left hand object is a group. If you enter the group, and edit there, your changes are repeated.

There is also a hidden 'construction' layer, which is only interesting, if you want to redo and change the design.


The platonic bodies
===================

To build a set of one each, you need to cut 3 copies of triangle_flower.svg, 2 copies of square_flower.svg and
one copy of square_flower.svg. You'll actually get enough material for an extra tetraeders and an extra cube
out of this set, So start practising assembly with these.

If you have multiple colors of paper, you may want to make more copies and assemble multicolored objects.


Tetraeder
---------

Requires 4 pieces from triangle_flower.svg.


Hexaeder
--------

The cube recquires 6 pieces from square_flower.svg -- so you can actually build two cubes per sheet.


Octaeder
--------

Requires 8 pieces from triangle_flower.svg -- so you get one tetraeder and one oactaeder from one sheet


Dodecaeder
----------

Requires 12 pieces or two sheets of pentagon_flower.svg -- this object is somewhat bigger than the others.


Ikosaeder
---------

Requires 20 pieces or two sheets of triangle_flower.svg.
